# CSE1322L - Kennesaw State University
The following are submissions for CSE1322L. All code here is commented for so
the reader can understand what is being done. If something is unclear feel free
to create an issue.

This repo can be found on both [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/yemou/cse1322l) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/yemouu/cse1322l).

## Cheating
This repository was not made public until after the exam in an attempt to
prevent cheating. If it comes to my attention that assignment questions have not
changed, the repo will be set back to private.

## Licensing
I do not own any of the assignment questions. These questions belong to Kennesaw
State University (as far as i know). If requested by a KSU representitive,
questions will be removed from this repo.

I DO NOT OWN ANY FILES PREFIXED WITH `KSU_` OR THAT SAY `KSU PROVIDED FILE` ON THE
FIRST LINE. THESE FILES BELONG TO KSU AND DO NOT NECESSARILY BELONG TO THE PUBLIC
DOMAIN.

All of my submissions are licensed under the public domain.
