## Cheating
This repository was not made public until after the exam in an attempt to
prevent cheating. If it comes to my attention that assignment questions have not
changed, the repo will be set back to private.

## Licensing
I do not own any of the assignment questions. These questions belong to Kennesaw
State University (as far as i know). If requested by a KSU representitive,
questions will be removed from this repo.

I DO NOT OWN ANY FILES PREFIXED WITH `KSU_`.

All of my submissions are licensed under the public domain.
